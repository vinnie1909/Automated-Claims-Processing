# Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock's data automation, agents, and knowledge bases to automate the insurance claim lifecycle. We'll show how to use Bedrock data automation to create a custom blueprint and process claims forms.We also demonstrate the end-to-end-flow of processing the claims data using a Bedrock Knowledge Base and Agents.

# Context
Insurance companies deal with a high volume of claims, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors when processed manually. By leveraging capabilities provided by Amazon Bedrock including Bedrock Data Automation and Bedrock Agents, We can create an AI-powered system that streamlines the claim process, improves efficiency, and enhances customer experience.

# Architecture

# Prerequisites
Before starting this notebook, ensure you have:

An AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock
Necessary IAM permissions to create and manage Bedrock resources
AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed
A sample dataset of insurance claims (we'll use a synthetic dataset for this demo)

# Setup
In the following sections we would run through the process to setup the AWS resources required to run the end-to-end flow for claim processing

# Import Remote Libraries
First, let's import the necessary libraries.

We'll use the us-west-2 region and create the boto3 clients for the required AWS services
